In the silence of our souls, a rhythm takes control,
No need for words, our hearts converse, in melodies untold.
A symphony of feelings, emotions intertwine,
The language of the heart, in every beat, we find.

Without words, we speak, through the notes we play,
In the language of the soul, our spirits dance and sway.
The power of the music, a universal embrace,
A melody that transcends, connecting time and space.

Without words, we sing, in the language of the night,
A serenade of silence, where emotions take flight.
Harmony unspoken, a dialogue profound,
In the world of sound, our love is found.

A gentle piano whisper, a guitar's tender kiss,
Notes that linger in the air, expressing what we miss.
The bassline of our heartbeat, the drums that never cease,
In this silent conversation, our unity finds its peace.

Without words, we speak, through the notes we play,
In the language of the soul, our spirits dance and sway.
The power of the music, a universal embrace,
A melody that transcends, connecting time and space.

Without words, we sing, in the language of the night,
A serenade of silence, where emotions take flight.
Harmony unspoken, a dialogue profound,
In the world of sound, our love is found.

Strings strumming softly, a saxophone's embrace,
In the absence of words, our emotions find their place.
A trumpet's declaration, a flute's sweet refrain,
A musical connection that words cannot explain.

Without words, we sing, in the language of the night,
A serenade of silence, where emotions take flight.
Harmony unspoken, a dialogue profound,
In the world of sound, our love is found.

As the music fades away, the silence takes its cue,
But the echoes of our song, forever linger, true.
Without words, we've spoken, in this melody unheard,
A timeless conversation, where love is the only word.
